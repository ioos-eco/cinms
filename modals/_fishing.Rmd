##### Commercial

![**Figure App.C.4.4.** Trends over time in commercial fishing activity in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) based on landings pounds (blue bars) and value (dark blue line) for seven fisheries from 2000 to 2012. Landings were combined for twenty-two blocks that overlap substantially with the sanctuary (see Figure App.C4.3. for map). Landings for market squid, sardine, and anchovy declined recently while landings of crabs increased. Landings of sea urchin, spiny lobster, and prawn and shrimp were relatively stable.

##### Recreational

![**Figure App.C.4.2.** Fishing activity landings for Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFVs) operating out of ports in Santa Barbara and Ventura from 2000 to 2012. Activity landings in 2011 and 2012 returned to levels seen in the early 2000s. Figure: Chen et al. 2015b](../img/cinms_cr/App.C.4.2b.CPFV_landings.jpg)

##### Deep-water

![**Figure App.C.3.2.** Landings (in pounds) and the relative contribution of gear types has changed over time due to changing regulations, economics, and consumer demand. Since 2002, there is zero to minimal set net and trawl landings, and reduced landings for bottom longlines and traps until 2008, followed by a dramatic increase in bottom longline and trap landings to peak levels.

##### Trawling

![**Figure App.C.3.3.** Trawling landings across the Southern California Bight, as illustrated by CDFW 10 square kilometer blocks and shown along with known locations of stony deep-water corals. Trawling is known to disturb bottom habitats and deep-sea corals. Even though trawling effort has decreased in recent years, the impacts of this gear type can be long lived.

##### Fixed Gear

![**Figure App.C.3.4.** Historical landings of fixed gear that could impact benthic habitats are shown along with the locations of deep-sea gorgonians in the map above. Fixed gear usage is moderate around the Channel Islands and likely impacts gorgonians in CINMS habitats. Data is from 2007 to 2011. Data source: CDFW, Perry et al 2010; Map: P. Etnoyer/NOAA, Etnoyer et al. 2015](../img/cinms_cr/App.C.3.4_SWFSC_Fixed2007-2011_Gorgonians.jpg)

##### Trawl & Fixed Gear with MPAs 

![**Figure App.C.3.5.** Overlay of trawl and fixed gear fishing activity from 2007 to 2011 and protected areas is shown in the map above. Much of the landings is off the Santa Barbara mainland coast; however, fixed gear usage regularly occurs in sanctuary waters Data source: CDFW; Map: P.
