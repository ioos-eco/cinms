### Details

Landings (in pounds) and the relative contribution of gear types has changed over time due to changing regulations, economics, and consumer demand. Since 2002, there is zero to minimal set net and trawl landings, and reduced landings for bottom longlines and traps until 2008, followed by a dramatic increase in bottom longline and trap landings to peak levels.

## Figure App.C.3.3.

A map showing landings of fish caught by trawling (a method of commercial fishing) across the Southern California Bight (2007-2011). Locations of known deep-water corals, which are very vulnerable to trawling, are indicated on the map. Data source: CDFW, Perry et al 2010; Map credit: [P. Etnoyer/NOAA](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/oceanage/03etnoyer/welcome.html), Etnoyer et al. 2015.

### Details

[Trawling](https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary) landings across the Southern California Bight, as illustrated by CDFW 10 square kilometer blocks and shown along with known locations of stony deep-water corals. Trawling is known to disturb bottom habitats and deep-sea corals. Even though trawling effort has decreased in recent years, the impacts of this gear type can be long lived.

## Figure App.C.3.4.

A map showing landings of fish caught by fixed gear (a method of commercial fishing) across the Southern California Bight (2007-2011). Locations of known deep-water gorgonians, which are very vulnerable to trawling, are indicated on the map. Data source: CDFW, Perry et al 2010; Map credit: [P. Etnoyer/NOAA](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/oceanage/03etnoyer/welcome.html), Etnoyer et al. 2015.

### Details

Historical landings of [fixed gear](https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary) that could impact benthic habitats are shown along with the locations of deep-sea gorgonians in the map above. Fixed gear usage is moderate around the Channel Islands and likely impacts gorgonians in CINMS habitats. Data is from 2007 to 2011.

## Figure App.C.4.10b. 

Number of confirmed reports of large whales, including humpback, gray, and blue whales entangled in fishing gear, ropes and other sources along the U.S. West Coast from 2000 to 2019. Graph from NOAA Fisheries 2019 West Coast Whale Entanglement Summary Report. Last updated April 2020.

In the legend, color represents the different species of whales and “n” represents the total number of that species confirmed entangled in the study period. Of the 46 confirmed whale entanglements, 30 were reported off California, 6 of which originated from southern California (Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties). However, the location where entangled animals are observed and reported does not necessarily reflect where and when the entanglement originated. Figure credit: D. Lawson/NMFS WCRO PRD.

### Details

Annual number of large whale entanglements reported along the U.S. West Coast. Reports of entanglements have increased in recent years. Factors contributing to this trend likely include an increasing overlap of whale activities (e.g., migrating, feeding) with human activities that have the potential to entangle whales (e.g., fishing, buoy installation) and an increase in on-the-water observers likely to report entangled individuals (e.g., whale watching, recreational boating). Confirmed entanglements from 2000 to 2019 of gray and humpback whales include 11 from Santa Barbara and two from Ventura counties.

## Figure App.C.4.11a.

A map showing an unprecedented West Coast-wide [harmful algal bloom (HAB)](https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary) that extended from the Gulf of Alaska to southern California. March 2015 (left, before the HAB) as compared to May (right, during the HAB). Data source: Satellite data were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) using a combination of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) chlorophyll products. Data were processed using standard OBPG processing with 4 kilometer imagery. Figure credit: McCabe et al. 2016.

### Details

In May 2015, an unprecedented West Coast-wide harmful algal bloom (HAB) extended from the Gulf of Alaska to southern California. The bloom was composed of _Pseudo-nitzschia_, a toxigenic diatom that has the ability to produce domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin that can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) and threaten human health if affected shellfish are consumed. These satellite images show chlorophyll-a estimates averaged over the periods of March 27-31, 2015 (left panel), and May, 6-8, 2015 (right panel). 

## Figure App.D.8.3.

A figure showing three metrics of climate and ocean conidtions in the North Pacific Basin from 1999 to 2018. Data source: [NPGO](http://www.o3d.org/npgo/), [PDO](http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/), [ONI](http://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php). Figure: I. Schroeder/NOAA

### Details

Three indices of climate and ocean conditions in the North Pacific Basin shifted in 2014 from conditions promoting high primary productivity to less productive conditions. The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) indicates the presence/absence of El Niño conditions with positive anomaly values (red) denoting El Niño conditions and negative values denoting La Niña conditions. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index is related to North Pacific sea surface temperature with cold regimes (blue) associated with higher productivity and warmer regimes (red) associated with lower productivity. The North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) is influenced by sea level and circulation patterns. Positive values of the NPGO (red) are linked to stronger currents and higher productivity while negative values (blue) are linked to weaker currents and lower productivity. The graphs show the long-term mean (0) ± 3.0 standard deviations based on the full time series. 

## Figure App.D.8.4. 

A figure showing a time-series of temperature profiles (ºC) sampled in the Channel Islands for 1997-2015 (top) and 2009 - 2015 (bottom). Figure: Siegel et al. submitted. [Plumes and Blooms](http://www.oceancolor.ucsb.edu/plumes_and_blooms)

### Details

Time-series of temperature (°C) profiles at Plumes and Blooms sampling station #4 (34°15.01'N, 119°54.38'W, see Figure D6.2) for (a) 1997-2015 and (b) 2009-2015. While station #4 is outside the sanctuary boundary and there are other sampling sites within the sanctuary, it is the only sampling site that collects measurements throughout the water column, versus from just surface waters. This time-depth contour plot was generated via ordinary krigging with a generalized exponential-Bessel fitting model (GLOBEC Kriging Software Package v3.0), with interpolation length scales of 30 days (time axis) and ten meters (depth axis). The time and location of each actual sample are shown as black dots, allowing the observation of periods where data gaps exist. Note: This is variant of a similar figure shown during the expert workshop.

### Details

1984 to 2015 giant kelp biomass aerial extent varies seasonally and annually, with data showing high variation over three decades; however, recent data suggests kelp biomass as is near an all time low. 

## Figure App.E.10.14.

A figure showing the density of giant kelp across all five Sanctuary islands from 2005 to 2016. Figure credit: [Channel Islands National Park](https://www.nps.gov/chis/index.htm).

### Details

Giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) density from 2005 to 2016 at all five sanctuary islands as counted by the national park subtidal surveys. Kelp density is currently at extreme lows for the three western islands, but the warmer islands (Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands) have recently experienced sharp increases in kelp density. 

## Figure App.E.10.20.

A figure showing the area covered by brown algae at two sites on Santa Cruz Island from 2000 to 2015. Data source: SBC LTER; Figure credit: [R. Freedman/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/freedman.html).

### Details

Brown algae percent cover from [LTER](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/) subtidal surveys at Santa Cruz Island (two sites, dark blue) and the mainland (nine sites, light blue) are shown in the trendlines above. Brown algae has been in decline since 2010 and is near record lows in the Santa Barbara Channel both at the mainland and in the Sanctuary.

### Details

Foliose red algae percent cover from LTER subtidal surveys at Santa Cruz Island (two sites, dark blue) and the mainland (nine sites, light blue) are shown. Red algae cover has been slowly increasing from the start of the dataset, but has remained stable at about 30 percent cover at both Santa Cruz Island and the mainland since 2010.

A map showing eelgrass bed locations around the Northern Channel Islands. Data source: NMFS, UCSB, and CINMS; Map credit: [M. Cajandig/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/cajandig.html).

### Details

CINMS eelgrass bed locations in the map above are a compilation from UCSB, NMFS, and CINMS data. Surveys for eelgrass occurred at different times and the bed persistence is unknown at many locations. UCSB data comes from transects performed by UCSB researchers while the NMFS data comes from sidescan sonar surveys along the coastline. 

## Figure App.E.10.24.

A map showing eelgrass beds mapped by diver surveys on Anacapa Island in 2009 (light blue) and 2012 (dark red). Data source: J. Altstatt/ UCSB and CINMS; Map credit: [M. Cajandig/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/cajandig.html).

### Details

Eelgrass bed extent from diver surveys at Anacapa Island in 2009 (light blue) and 2012 (dark red). Overall, bed extent appears to be declining at Anacapa between 2009 and 2012, with the eastern bed being extirpated. Trap fishing, anchoring, and seafloor disturbance are thought to contribute to declines in bed extent and shoot density, with eelgrass beds inside the marine reserve having higher shoot density than those in areas with less protection. 

## Figure App.E.10.25.

A map showing eelgrass beds on Santa Cruz Island from a 2015 survey using sidescan sonar. Data source: NMFS; Map credit: [M. Cajandig/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/cajandig.html).

### Details

National Marine Fisheries Service surveys in 2015 for eelgrass using interferometric sidescan sonar to map bed extent are shown. Dark blue represents bathylines generated from the sidescan data and area surveyed. Turquoise areas represents eelgrass bed extent generated from sidescan data. Eelgrass beds in these areas are thought to have persisted for long periods of time and appear to be relatively stable; however, surveys on the eelgrass health and shoot density have not been conducted.

### Details

The breakdown for the number of deep-water soft corals colonies observed in each genus for the Southern California Bight. Among the 34,792 images collected by the SWFSC Sebastes ROV between 2003 and 2011 throughout the entire Southern California Bight, researchers observed a total of 5,419 colonies. Adelogorgia was most common with 1,832 colonies in 535 observations. _Eugorgia_ was second most common with 792 colonies in 436 observations. 

## Figure App.E.10.28.

A figure showing different levels of damage on gorgonians on Anacapa Island as seen during remotely-operated-vehicle surveys (2005, 2009, and 2014). Figure credit: [MARE](https://www.maregroup.org/).

### Details

Percent of gorgonians showing different levels damage at Anacapa Island during ROV surveys in 2005, 2009, and 2014. By 2014, less than 30 percent of observed gorgonians at Anacapa Island had no recognizable damage. Interactions with fishing gear and increasing water temperatures are thought to contribute to the increases in observed gorgonian damage at Anacapa Island. Gorgonian populations at more western islands are thought to fare better compared to Anacapa due to cooler water and less fishing effort. 

## Figure App.E.10.29.

A figure showing the concentration of the mineral [aragonite](https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary) (a form of calcium carbonate) at different depths at Anacapa Island from 2007 to 2014. Figure credit: Etnoyer et al. 2015.

### Details

[Aragonite saturations](https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary) are shown at 75 meters (m) (green), 150 m (blue) and 300 m (red) at Anacapa Island. As pH of seawater decreases (e.g., from the deposition of atmospheric CO2), the saturation state of aragonite (Ωarg) decreases. Aragonite undersaturation (Ωarg < 1) favors dissolution over calcification, making it harder for organisms to make and maintain their shells or skeletons in the case of corals. In coastal upwelling zones, such as the California Current, the aragonite saturation state and depth are variable and shallow, respectively. With ocean acidification, aragonite saturation depths have shoaled over the past three decades and are now typically around 200 m in the California Current (Turi et al. 2016). At the local scale at Anacapa Island, the aragonite saturation depth has hovered around 130 m over the past eight years. As strong of a shoaling trend as at the California Current scale has not been seen. Instead, the usual seasonal variation but relatively stable aragonite saturation states over time (no trend), particularly in deep water, have been seen.

### Details

Mussel tissue contaminant monitoring sites from NOAA's Mussel Watch Program are shown in southern California (top) and around CINMS (bottom). Only one site within CINMS has been monitored consistently over time: Fraser Point, SCI (1986-2010), Other monitoring sites include: Anacapa (2008 only); Tyler Bight, south SMI (1988 only); and Otter Harbor, north SMI (2008-2010).

### Details

Time series of arsenic (as μg/g dry weight) in _Mytilus_ spp. at Fraser Point, Santa Cruz Island is shown above. Data is from NOAA's Mussel Watch Program (monitored 1986-2010). Arsenic values have been slowly declining in _Mytilus_ spp tissue. Arsenic can impact a number of enzymes and has a widespread effects on a number of organ systems. There are multiple potential explanations for this finding, including limited spatial resolution, limited recent data, possible return to background levels consistent with the southern California mainland after remediation, or improved instrumentation and analytics that have been developed since data collection began. Due to this, more through research and data collection is required to confirm this trend.

### Details

This graph is a California coastwide comparison of total extractables (TE) from _Mytilus_ spp. tissue for heavy metals. Data is from NOAA's Mussel Watch Program (monitored 1986-2010). The horizontal lines of the red box illustrate the 25th, median, and 75th percentiles, while the top and bottom whiskers represent the 10th and 90th percentiles. Black dots are data points from collection sites and the green ellipsoids represent mean concentration values for metals from sites within CINMS (n = 3). There are multiple potential explanations for this finding, including limited spatial resolution, limited recent data, possible return to background levels consistent with the southern California mainland after remediation, or improved instrumentation and analytics that have been developed since data collection began. Due to this, more through research and data collection is required to confirm this trend.

A figure showing levels of cancer-causing petroleum-linked chemicals found in the Channel Islands (blue) and offshore sites (red). Figure credit: D. Apeti/[NOAA, Mussel Watch](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/mussel_watch.html).

### Details

Mean Total Extractables (TE) for individual Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons or PAHs are compared between Channel Islands (blue) and other offshore sites (red). PAHs are organic contaminants that are carcinogenic. [Invertebrate](https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary) species typically have limited ability to metabolize PAHs; however, they typically do not biomagnify because vertebrates can metabolize them more easily. Concentrations of PAHs are variable, but concentrations at CINMS are usually equivalent, if not lower than other offshore locations. There are multiple potential explanations for this finding, including limited spatial resolution, limited recent data, possible return to background levels consistent with the southern California mainland after remediation, or improved instrumentation and analytics that have been developed since data collection began. Due to this, more through research and data collection is required to confirm this trend.

A figure showing the deposition of tar (green) at Fraser Cove, Santa Cruz Island, compared to bare rock (red) and barnacle cover (grey) from 1994 to 2014. Monitoring data provided by [Channel Islands National Park Rocky Intertidal Monitoring program](https://sanctuarysimon.org/dbtools/project-database/index.php?ID=100508)

### Details

Tar deposition percent cover (green) at Fraser Cove, Santa Cruz Island is compared to bare rock (red) and a barnacle complex (*Balanus/Chtamalus*, grey). The park only monitors tar at Fraser Cove and it is believed that tar at this location is from natural seeps. There was a slight decline (< 10 percent) in tar cover in 2014 from long-term mean, but tar still covered approximately 50 percent of plots. 

## Figure App.E.11.8.

A figure showing tar deposition at Fraser Cove, Santa Cruz Island from 2002 to 2019.  Monitoring data provided by [Channel Islands National Park Rocky Intertidal Monitoring program](https://sanctuarysimon.org/dbtools/project-database/index.php?ID=100508)


### Details

Tar deposition percent cover at Fraser Cove, Santa Cruz Island. The park only monitors tar at Fraser Cove and it is believed that tar at this location is from natural seeps. The blue line represents the mean percent cover at a given year while the red dashed line represents the long-term mean. There was a slight decline (< 10 percent) in tar cover in 2014 from the long-term mean, but tar still covered approximately 50 percent of plots.

A map showing the relative impact of human activity on the seafloor across different regions of the Southern California Bight, using the Benthic Response Index as an indicator. Data Source: K. Schiff/ [SCCWRP](https://www.sccwrp.org/); Map credit: [M. Cajandig/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/cajandig.html).

### Details

The Southern California Water Research Project uses a diversity index of tolerant and sensitive [infauna](https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary), also known as the Benthic Response Index (BRI), to gauge the ecosystem impact from anthropogenic contamination. The map above shows the 2013 locations of samples and the BRI trends at each location. Previously, island sites were all considered 100 percent pristine (reference), but now roughly 70 percent of samples are considered degraded from that status. Decline in BRI was particularly prevalent around Santa Cruz Island. This decline in BRI was not mirrored in other regions in southern California. The most recent samples, collected in 2013, found that ten of the 15 sites in Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary had infaunal community compositions that were shifting towards species more tolerant of degraded conditions (red) compared to the samples collected previously. 

## Figure App.E.11.10.

A figure showing the relative impact of human activity on the seafloor across different regions of the Southern California Bight, using the Benthic Response Index as an indicator. Figure credit: K. Schiff/[SCCWRP](https://www.sccwrp.org/)

### Details

Comparisons of the Benthic Response Index (BRI), a diversity index of contaminant tolerant and sensitive infauna, among different regions of the Southern California Bight is shown. Island shelf sites (upper right) had been at reference levels (highest ranking) until 2013, when approximately 30 percent of sites were reclassified as low impact. Other regions in the bight did not experience such a large BRI decline as the island shelf, which indicates potential new impacts to sediments around southern California Islands. 

## Figure App.E.11.11.

A map showing sediment sample locations and their respective Benthic Reponse Index sites from a 2013 Southern California Bight-wide survey. The Benthic Response Index is a measure of the impact of humans on the seafloor. Figure credit: K. Schiff/[SCCWRP](https://www.sccwrp.org/).

### Details

SCCWRP sediment sample locations and their respective Benthic Response Index (BRI) from the 2013 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. In order to create the BRI, infaunal invertebrate communities are characterized based on the proportion of taxa present in a sample that are sensitive to as opposed to tolerant of contaminant levels. Using a composite score of the infauna community, SCCRWP labels sample sites as reference, low impact, moderate impact, or high impact. 

## Figure App.E.11.12.

A map showing DDT contaminant levels in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. Figure credit: Schiff et al. 2011.

### Details

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contaminant levels in sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP's 2008 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. DDT is most prominent around the Ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Santa Monica Bay. DDT is a legacy contaminant, which means it persists in the environment long after introduction. A large amount of DDT in the bight came from the dumping of the contaminant by the Montrose Chemical Company off Palos Verdes until the early 1980s, which is why the surrounding areas have high DDT levels. CINMS is relatively far from the spill site and thus, has limited DDT concentrations in sediments. 

## Figure App.E.11.13.

A map showing copper contaminant levels in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. Figure credit: Schiff et al. 2011.

### Details

Copper contaminant levels at sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP's 2008 Bight wide survey are shown in the map. Copper is a heavy metal contaminant that in high concentrations can be toxic to living marine resources. Concentrations in CINMS are consistently low compared with other regions in the southern California Bight. 

## Figure App.E.11.14.

A map showing silver contaminant levels in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. Figure credit: Schiff et al. 2011.

### Details

Silver contaminant levels in sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP's 2008 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. Silver is a heavy metal contaminant that in high concentrations can be toxic to living marine resources. Concentrations in CINMS and the Santa Barbara Channel are consistently low compared other regions in the Southern California Bight. High concentrations of silver appear to be clustered off the two largest population centers: Los Angeles and San Diego. 

## Figure App.E.11.15.

A map showing the contaminent levels of Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (which are used as flame retardants) in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. Figure credit: Schiff et al. 2011.

### Details

Sediment contaminant levels for Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the Southern California Bight are shown in the map above. These products are typically added to manufactured products as flame retardants. Concentrations of PBDEs are low at the islands compared to mainland areas. 

## Figure App.E.11.16.

A map showing pyrethroid (insecticide) contaminant levels in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. Figure credit: Schiff et al. 2011.

### Details

Pyrethroids contaminant levels in sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP's 2008 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. Pyrethroids are typically pollutants coming from insecticide use. In recent years, there has been no agriculture on the islands and thus, pyrethroids are absent from CINMS sediments. Sediments adjacent to CINMS off Ventura have low levels of pyrethroids likely due to agriculture in that area. 

## Figure App.E.11.17.

A figure showing the amount of impacted sediment in varying categories of exposure to sediment contamination ("Cat") across five sites and three years. Figure credit: Schiff et al. 2011.

### Details

Percent area of impacted sediments by stratum and survey year in varying categories of exposure to sediment contamination are shown in the bar plot. Category 1 is minimal exposure; Category 2 is low exposure; Category 3 is moderate exposure; and Category 4 is high exposure. Categories are determined by two prominent chemistry indices determined by analyzing a suite of chemical concentrations present in sediment samples. Missing bars represent no data. In minimal exposure, sediment-associated contamination may be present, but exposure is unlikely to result in effects. In low exposure, small increase in contaminant exposure may be associated with increased effects, but magnitude or frequency of occurrence of biological impacts is low. In moderate exposure, there is clear evidence of sediment contaminant exposure at concentrations that are likely to result in biological effects. For high exposure, contaminant exposure is highly likely to result in substantial biological effects. The Channel Islands have no sediments in Category 4 and the large majority of sediments are in Category 1 or 2, thus indicating limited contamination impact in sanctuary sediments. At this time, the suites of chemical indices have not yet been completed for the 2008 bight-wide survey. 

## Figure App.F.12.2.

A figure showing the average number of ochre stars (*Pisaster ochraceus*) counted each year during 30-minute searches at monitoring sites at each of the five islands monitored by the Channel Islands National Park (CHIS) rocky intertidal community monitoring program which is part of the  Multi-agency Rocky Intertidal Network (MARINe).

### Details

Use the map tab above to see the location of sites on the five islands in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. In the past decade, most locations had more than 100 sea stars counted during 30-minute searches. In 2014, abundances ranged from 0–23 individuals per site with the majority of sites having less than ten.

### Figure App.F.12.3.

A figure showing how the sizes of ochre stars (*Pisaster ochraceus*) compare over time and across the five islands monitored by the Channel Islands National Park (CHIS) rocky intertidal community monitoring program which is part of the  Multi-agency Rocky Intertidal Network (MARINe).

### Details

Box plots show annual size frequency distributions of ochre star P. ochraceus at each island. Black lines represent mean sizes of ochre stars at each island pooled across sites. Red lines represent the mean of all years. Note that data for 2014 are not presented due to insufficient numbers of ochre stars encountered to estimate population size frequency. Use the map tab above to see the location of sites on the five islands in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.

A figure showing the density of red and purple sea urchins near four of the Channel Islands. Data source: PISCO; Figure credit: [R. Freedman/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/freedman.html).

### Details

Mean density (+/- standard error) of red sea urchin _Mesocentrotus franciscanus_ (top) and purple sea urchin _Strongylocentrotus purpuratus_ (bottom) at 14 sites across four islands in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary monitored by the PISCO kelp forest monitoring program from 2003-2016. Recently, density of both species has declined at eastern islands (Anacapa and Santa Cruz) and increased at western islands (Santa Rosa and San Miguel). Sea urchins are counted by SCUBA divers swimming along transect lines. Sea urchin density was averaged across all monitoring sites at each island, including sites located inside and outside of marine reserves and conservation areas, to examine course-scale trends by island. At a finer scale, sea urchin density is responding differently inside and outside of some marine protected areas (MPAs) in CINMS. A discussion of MPA effects in CINMS is available in MPA Effects. 

## Figure App.F.12.6.

The average amount of red and purple sea urchins at several measuring locations on the Channel Islands and the mainland. Data source: SBC LTER; Figure credit: [R. Freedman/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/freedman.html).

### Details

Average abundance (+/- standard error) of sea urchins (red sea urchin _Mesocentrotus franciscanus_ and purple sea urchin _Strongylocentrotus purpuratus_ combined) at two island (dark blue) and nine mainland (light blue) kelp forest sites monitored by the Santa Barbara Channel Long-term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) program. Overall abundance of sea urchins appears stable at island sites over the available time series. 

## Figure App.F.12.7.

A figure showing the amount of three important sea stars at 14 different sites acros the four northern Channel Islands from 2003 to 2016. Data source: PISCO; Figure credit: [R. Freedman/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/freedman.html).

### Details

Average density (+/- standard error) of giant spined star (*Pisaster giganteus*) (top), ochre star (*P. ochraceus*) (middle) and sunflower star (*Pycnopodia helianthoides*) (bottom) at 14 sites across four islands in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary monitored by the PISCO kelp forest monitoring program from 2003-2016. Sea stars are counted by SCUBA divers swimming along transect lines.

Location of Southern California Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Surveys. Annual surveys for reef-associated fish have occurred since 2004 in September and October using 75 hooks per site at depths ranging from 37 to 227 meters. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) per year was calculated for three spatial scales: CINMS included sites within the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary boundary (n = 26); CINMS region included sites inside the red box (n = 55); and Southern California Bight included all sites in the sampling program (n = 121).

### Details

Locations sampled by the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Surveys for demersal fish inhabiting trawlable habitat along the upper continental slope and shelf. Annual surveys have occurred along the entire U.S. West Coast from May to October each year at depths from 55 meters to 1,280 meters. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) per year was calculated for three spatial scales relative to Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary: CINMS included sites within the CINMS boundary (light blue shading, n = 130, 2008-2014, 116 species); CINMS region includes sites inside the red box (n = 639, 2003--2014, 192 species); Southern California Bight included sites inside the blue box (n = 1,353, 2003-2014, 247 species). 

## Figure App.F.13.22.

A figure showing trends in seabird abundance and the relative abundace of krill and forage fish from 1987 to 2011. Figure credit: Sydeman et al. 2015.

### Details

Trends in seabird abundance and the relative abundance of krill and forage fish, based on CalCOFI/CCE LTER program data (1987-2011). Spring and summer seabird density declined by 2 percent per year, mostly in the northern sector of the study region. Krill showed variable trends. Nearshore forage fish, dominated by northern anchovy, and offshore mesopelagic species show declines in relative abundance over this period.

### Details

Live pup count (top) and female pup growth index for California sea lions (*Zalophus californianus*) from 1997 to 2019. Recent trends in pup counts have been stable, but declining for pup growth likely due to low availability of prey resources in central and southern California, which is the foraging range of nursing females. Symbol at upper right indicates whether data over the last five years (green shaded areas) had a positive trend ( ), a negative trend (), or no trend (↔). Symbol at lower right indicates whether the mean over the past five years was greater than (+), less than (-), or within 1 standard deviation (●) of the mean of the full time series.

## Figure App.F.15.7.

A series of maps showing some unexpected trends in seabird species presence (A,C) and persistence of unexpected presence (B,D) around the Southern California Bight. Figure credit: Santora and Sydeman 2015.

### Details

Seabird species richness spatial anomalies (A,C) and persistence of hotspots (B,D) based on visual survey for seabirds during spring and summer CalCOFI surveys from 1987 to 2012. A spatial anomaly was computed from the grand spatial mean and standard deviation for each block. Cool colors denote blocks below the mean and warm colors denote blocks above. Higher species richness and hotspot persistence (red, yellow) is observed along the coast and around Channel Islands compared to offshore (blue). Seabird species richness calculations based on 68 species/taxa. 

## Figure App.F.15.8.

A graph showing the change of seabird species presence in spring (green) and summer (red) from 1987 to 2015. Figure credit: Leising et al. 2015.

### Details

Change over time in seabird species richness anomaly (i.e., number of species observed per survey compared to the long-term average) based on visual survey of seabird distribution and abundance during CalCOFI spring and summer surveys since spring 1987. Seabird species richness has exhibited a long-term decline in the CalCOFI region, and has been negative since 2013. The decline in species richness possibly indicates that biophysical changes occurring in the southern California Current is impacting the overall at-sea seabird community.

A figure showing the amount of non-native invertebrates and algae foundin rocky intertidal sites in Southern California; the two sites in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary are highlighted by the black box. Figure credit: Blanchette et al. 2015.

### Details

Percent cover of non-indigenous taxa in [PISCO](http://www.piscoweb.org/) biodiversity surveys at rocky intertidal sites in southern California; the two sites in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary are highlighted by the black box. PISCO found the turfy red alga *Caulacanthus okamurae* (formerly *C. ustulatus*), *Lomentaria hakodatensis*, and the brown algae *Sargassum muticum* at Middle West on Anacapa Island. The mussel *Mytilus galloprovincialis* was found at two sites on Anacapa Island. Additionally, the report noted that *Annalipus japonicus*, a brown alga, was found at Crook Point (San Miguel Island) south of its published southern range limit of Point Conception. Shallow subtidal *Sargassum muticum* was densely abundant in many areas in 1970s and 1980s, but has become relatively less common and more interspersed with native species in recent years (J. Engle, pers. comm.). For more information, consult Figure App.F.14.1 in the CINMS 2016 Condition Report.

### Details

First seen in Long Beach Harbor in 2003, _Sargassum horneri_ had spread to many mainland and island sites in southern California by 2015. First observed in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary at Anacapa in 2009, it had expanded to both Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz islands by 2015. Red ovals highlight observations that are inside Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.

### Details

Presence (red) and absence (green) of _Watersipora spp._ on recently surveyed oil platforms, other artificial surfaces, and natural reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel. This non-indigenous bryozoan was found to occur on only two of 15 natural reefs surveyed in the northern Channel Islands. 

## Figure App.F.15.1.

A series of figures showing the equally-common species for kelp forest fishes (top), mobile bottom-associated invetebrates (middle) and deep water fishes (bottom) around the four Northern Channel Islands from 2005 to 2014. Data source: Amalgamated dataset of [SBC LTER](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/), [CINP Kelp Forest Monitoring Program](https://www.nps.gov/im/medn/kelp-forest-communities.htm), and [PISCO](http://www.piscoweb.org/); Figure credit: [SBC MBON](http://sbc.marinebon.org/).

### Details

Mean annual effective number of species for three taxonomic groups: kelp forest fishes (top), mobile demersal invertebrates (middle), and deeper water fishes (bottom). Shannon-Weiner diversity was converted to effective numbers of species, which allows for a more direct and intuitive comparison of community diversity over time. Kelp forest fish were surveyed across 86 shallow reef sites (3 to 16 meters depth) around the four northern Channel Islands from 2005 to 2014. Mobile invertebrates were surveyed across 63 shallow reef sites (3 to 16 meters depth) around the four northern Channel Islands from 1982 to 2016. Deep-water fish were surveyed at three reefs off the Channel Islands (Piggy Bank, Footprint, and Anacapa passage) at depths ranging from 40 to 407 meters in 1995 and annually between 1998 and 2011. Error bars indicate the 95 percent confidence interval in a given year. The horizontal line is the mean across sites over time. 

## Figure App.F.15.2.

A figure showing the temperature preferences for kelp-forest fish species across the four Northern Channel Islands. Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands show a more southern (warmer) collection of fish species while Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands have a more northern (cooler) collection of fish species. Data source: [CINP Kelp Forest Monitoring Program](https://www.nps.gov/im/medn/kelp-forest-communities.htm), and [PISCO](http://www.piscoweb.org/); Figure credit: [R. Freedman/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/freedman.html).

### Details

The thermal ratio of the kelp forest fish assemblage shows the relative proportion of the fish community that have a southern (warmer) vs. northern (cooler) affiliation. Islands to the east, Anacapa (orange) and Santa Cruz (green), have a higher ratio of warm:cool species than Santa Rosa (blue) and San Miguel (purple), which are to the west. Santa Cruz Island is highly variable possibly because it is in a transition zone in the thermal gradient around the islands, which may make the fish community at this island more susceptible to the influence of climate changes. Note the log scale for the Y-axis.

Right: a map showing a shift in sediment-dwelling invetebrate communites towards being more tolerant of sediment impacts based on a 2013 study. Figure credit: K. Schiff/[SCCWRP](https://www.sccwrp.org/).

### Details

(Left) Infaunal invertebrate communities are characterized based on the proportion of a sediment sample with taxa that are sensitive (green, reference) as opposed to tolerant (red, high disturbance) of contaminant levels. (Right) In the most recent samples collected in 2013, ten of the 15 sites in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary had an infaunal community composition that was shifting to that which is more tolerant of degraded conditions (red) compared to the samples collected previously. 

## Table App.F.13.2.

A table displaying the common and scientific names of species used to identify trends in fishing effort (with one type of fishing, known as fixed gear fishing) in the Southern California Bight from 2009 to 2016. Data source: [NMFS NWFSC](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/); Table credit: NOAA.

### Details

Common and scientific names of species selected for calculation of recent trends in CPUE from NMFS NWFSC Hook and Line surveys in the Southern California Bight. Of the more than 50 different species encountered in surveys from 2004—2015, the 15 species that were encountered most often (top 15 ranked species) were selected with the exception of sanddabs and squarespot rockfish, which are not well sampled by this survey method. The trend in annual CPUE was determined for the period 2009—2015 and is shown as increasing (↗), decreasing (↘), or no trend (↔) at the three spatial scales shown in Figure App.F.13.20. Three targeted or protected species were also included: cowcod, canary, and yelloweye rockfish (Note: These species were rarely encountered so observed trends may be misleading). Most strong regional trends (Southern California Bight and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary region) are reflected at the CINMS-level. Regional recovery or recruitment-driven population increases appears to be occurring for several species, including lingcod and bank rockfish. Trends were not strong for some rare species (e.g., cowcod and yelloweye). The CINMS trend was different than the larger sampling area for some species (e.g., bocaccio, chilipepper, and greenspotted rockfish) possibly influenced by depth segregation, effects of the Channel Islands network of MPAs, or regional/site level-effects amplified by low sample sizes. 

## Table App.F.13.3.

A table displaying the common and scientific names of species used to identify trends in fishing effort (with one type of fishing, known as trawl fishing) in the Southern California Bight from 2009 to 2016. Data source: [NMFS NWFSC](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/); Table credit: NOAA.

### Details

Common and scientific names of species selected for calculation of recent trends in CPUE from NMFS NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Surveys in the Southern California Bight. Of the more than 247 different species encountered in surveys from 2003 to 2014, the 23 species that were encountered most often were selected. The trend in annual CPUE was determined for the period 2009-2014 and is shown as increasing (↗), decreasing (↘), or no trend (↔) at the three spatial scales shown in Figure App.F.13.21. Yellow highlights the 11 species that appear to be well sampled in trawls at the shallower depths most commonly surveyed inside Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (67 percent of sites in CINMS < 200 meters). These shallower species appear to be stable or increasing in CINMS and the surrounding region. Most species with different short-term trends at the smaller and larger spatial scales are deepwater species not sampled well in shallow water stations in CINMS. 

## Table App.F.15.2.

A table showing trends in four indicators of [biodiversity](https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary) as they relate to the Southern California Bight, the area around Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and in the Sanctuary itself. Data source: [NMFS NWFSC](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/); Table credit: NOAA.

### Details

Short-term trend in annual mean species richness, species density, Simpson diversity, and mean trophic level (MTL) for West Coast demersal fishes collected during the NMFS U.S. West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey from 2008 to 2014 at three spatial scales (see map Figure App.F.13.21). Species richness is the count of the number of species present in a net sample. Species density is the number of species per unit area. Simpson diversity takes into account the number of species present, as well as the relative abundance of each species. Mean trophic level is the biomass-weighted average trophic level of all species in a net sample. Short-term trends are consistent across all three spatial scales. Most diversity measures show declines in the near term, whereas MTL shows near-term increases. More Information about how these indicators were calculated are available at https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/Assets/iea/california/Report/pdf/3.Ecological%20Integrity_2013.pdf.
