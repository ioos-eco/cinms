So how about here...

## Figure App.F.12.17.new

Location of regions from spring season net samples by the (CalCOFI) used in analyses of abundance and trends in pelagic resources: Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary region (red) includes CalCOFI stations inside and adjacent to CINMS; and Southern California Shelf (yellow) includes all CalCOFI stations over the shelf.

## Figure App.F.15.6.a-b

Mean species richness of fish larvae (ichthyoplankton) collected in net samples during spring CalCOFI cruises at sites in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) region and over the Southern California Shelf from 1978 to 2015. Species richness is the number of species present in a net sample. Species richness tends to increase in El NinÌƒo years due to influx of central Pacific species to the shelf. Sampling sites are shown on Figure App.F.12.17. Symbols on the graph are explained in the caption for Figure App.F.12.18. Data source: CalCOFI; Figure: A. Thompson/NOAA
