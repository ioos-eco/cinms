Location of regions from spring season net samples by the (**CalCOFI**; _Genus species_) used in analyses of abundance and trends in pelagic resources: Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary region (red) includes CalCOFI stations inside and adjacent to CINMS; and Southern California Shelf (yellow) includes all CalCOFI stations over the shelf.

## Figure App.F.12.19

Relative abundance of key forage groups collected in net samples during spring CalCOFI cruises at sites in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) and Southern California Shelf regions from 1978 to 2015. High energy taxa are Pacific sardines, northern anchovies, and and Myctophids. Medium-energy taxa are Pacific hake, shortbelly rockfish, and sanddabs. Although sardine were completely absent in net samples from 2011 to 2014 in the CINMS region, comparison with samples collected in the larger Southern California Shelf region reveal that sardine were at very low abundance but not completely absent from the region.

## Figure App.F.15.5

Relative abundance of cool-water and warm-water associated ichthyoplankton (fish larvae) groups collected in net samples during spring CalCOFI cruises at sites in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS)  and over the Southern California Shelf from 1978 to 2015. Sampling sites are shown on Figure App.F.12.17. Symbols on the graph are explained in the caption for Figure App.F.12.18. Data source: CalCOFI; Figure: A. Thompson/NOAA


## Figure App.F.15.6.a-b

Mean species richness of fish larvae (ichthyoplankton) collected in net samples during spring CalCOFI cruises at sites in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) region and over the Southern California Shelf from 1978 to 2015. Species richness is the number of species present in a net sample. Species richness tends to increase in El NinÌƒo years due to influx of central Pacific species to the shelf. Sampling sites are shown on Figure App.F.12.17. Symbols on the graph are explained in the caption for Figure App.F.12.18. Data source: CalCOFI; Figure: A. Thompson/NOAA

Relative abundance of cool-water (top panels) and warm-water (bottom panels) associated ichthyoplankton (fish larvae) groups collected in net samples during spring CalCOFI cruises at sites in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) region (left panels) and over the Southern California Shelf (right panels) from 1978 to 2015.

## Figure App.F.12.20.squid

Mean abundance of market squid (_Doryteuthis opalescens_) collected in net samples during CalCOFI cruises at only sites in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary region (top) and all sites over the Southern California Shelf (bottom) from 1997 to 2015 (sampling locations shown in Figure App.F12.17).
