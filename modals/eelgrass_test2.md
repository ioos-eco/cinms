<details><summary>Eelgrass cover at Frenchyâ€™s Cove from 2004 to 2016 after 2003 transplant. Data are collected from diver surveys along a 30 meter fixed transect with points scored every 10 centimeters. The transect lies within the transplant area at Frenchy's Cove are at approximately 24 feet in depth. Declines in eelgrass cover are thought to be potentially due to seafloor disturbance from anchoring and trap fishing. Figure: J.
