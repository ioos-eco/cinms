Although we can't always see them, infauna are the organisms that live within the sediment itself. From edible clams to microscopic worms, there's a whole world hidden under the ocean floor.

Comparisons of the Benthic Response Index (BRI), a diversity index of contaminant tolerant and sensitive infauna, among different regions of the Southern California Bight is shown. Island shelf sites (upper right) had been at reference levels (highest ranking) until 2013, when approximately 30 percent of sites were reclassified as low impact. Other regions in the bight did not experience such a large BRI decline as the island shelf, which indicates potential new impacts to sediments around southern California Islands. For more information, consult Figure App.E.11.10 in the [CINMS 2016 Condition Report](https://nmssanctuaries.blob.core.windows.net/sanctuaries-prod/media/docs/2016-condition-report-channel-islands-nms.pdf){target="_blank"}.</details>

The Southern California Water Research Project uses a diversity index of tolerant and sensitive infauna, also known as the Benthic Response Index (BRI), to gauge the ecosystem impact from anthropogenic contamination. The map above shows the 2013 locations of samples and the BRI trends at each location. Previously, island sites were all considered 100 percent pristine (reference), but now roughly 70 percent of samples are considered degraded from that status. Decline in BRI was particularly prevalent around Santa Cruz Island. This decline in BRI was not mirrored in other regions in southern California. The most recent samples, collected in 2013, found that ten of the 15 sites in Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary had infaunal community compositions that were shifting towards species more tolerant of degraded conditions (red) compared to the samples collected previously. For more information, consult Figure App.E.11.9 in the [CINMS 2016 Condition Report](https://nmssanctuaries.blob.core.windows.net/sanctuaries-prod/media/docs/2016-condition-report-channel-islands-nms.pdf){target="_blank"}.</details>

SCCWRP sediment sample locations and their respective Benthic Response Index (BRI) from the 2013 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. In order to create the BRI, infaunal invertebrate communities are characterized based on the proportion of taxa present in a sample that are sensitive to as opposed to tolerant of contaminant levels. Using a composite score of the infauna community, SCCRWP labels sample sites as reference, low impact, moderate impact, or high impact.
