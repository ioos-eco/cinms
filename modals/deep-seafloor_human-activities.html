As pH of seawater decreases (e.g., from the deposition of atmospheric CO2), the saturation state of aragonite (Ωarg) decreases. Aragonite undersaturation (Ωarg &lt; 1) favors dissolution over calcification, making it harder for organisms to make and maintain their shells or skeletons in the case of corals. In coastal upwelling zones, such as the California Current, the aragonite saturation state and depth are variable and shallow, respectively. With ocean acidification, aragonite saturation depths have shoaled over the past three decades and are now typically around 200 m in the California Current (Turi et al. 2016). At the local scale at Anacapa Island, the aragonite saturation depth has hovered around 130 m over the past eight years. As strong of a shoaling trend as at the California Current scale has not been seen. Instead, he usual seasonal variation but relatively stable aragonite saturation states over time (no trend), particularly in deep water, have been seen. Figure: Etnoyer et al. 2015

The map above shows the 2013 locations of samples and the BRI trends at each location. Previously, island sites were all considered 100 percent pristine (reference), but now roughly 70 percent of samples are considered degraded from that status. Decline in BRI was particularly prevalent around Santa Cruz Island. This decline in BRI was not mirrored in other regions in southern California. The most recent samples, collected in 2013, found that ten of the 15 sites in Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary had infaunal community compositions that were shifting towards species more tolerant of degraded conditions (red) compared to the samples collected previously.

<summary>Click for Details</summary> Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contaminant levels in sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP’s 2008 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. DDT is most prominent around the Ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Santa Monica Bay. DDT is a legacy contaminant, which means it persists in the environment long after introduction. A large amount of DDT in the bight came from the dumping of the contaminant by the Montrose Chemical Company off Palos Verdes until the early 1980s, which is why the surrounding areas have high DDT levels. CINMS is relatively far from the spill site and thus, has limited DDT concentrations in sediments. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

<summary>Click for Details</summary> Silver contaminant levels in sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP’s 2008 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. Silver is a heavy metal contaminant that in high concentrations can be toxic to living marine resources. Concentrations in CINMS and the Santa Barbara Channel are consistently low compared other regions in the Southern California Bight. High concentrations of silver appear to be clustered off the two largest population centers: Los Angeles and San Diego. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

Pyrethroids are typically pollutants coming from insecticide use. In recent years, there has been no agriculture on the islands and thus, pyrethroids are absent from CINMS sediments. Sediments adjacent to CINMS off Ventura have low levels of pyrethroids likely due to agriculture in that area. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

<summary>Click for Details</summary> Percent area of impacted sediments by stratum and survey year in varying categories of exposure to sediment contamination are shown in the bar plot. Category 1 is minimal exposure; Category 2 is low exposure; Category 3 is moderate exposure; and Category 4 is high exposure. Categories are determined by two prominent chemistry indices determined by analyzing a suite of chemical concentrations present in sediment samples. Missing bars represent no data. In minimal exposure, sediment-associated contamination may be present, but exposure is unlikely to result in effects. In low exposure, small increase in contaminant exposure may be associated with increased effects, but magnitude or frequency of occurrence of biological impacts is low. In moderate exposure, there is clear evidence of sediment contaminant exposure at concentrations that are likely to result in biological effects. For high exposure, contaminant exposure is highly likely to result in substantial biological effects. The Channel Islands have no sediments in Category 4 and the large majority of sediments are in Category 1 or 2, thus indicating limited contamination impact in sanctuary sediments. At this time, the suites of chemical indices have not yet been completed for the 2008 bight-wide survey. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011
