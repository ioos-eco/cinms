<summary>Click for Details</summary> In May 2015, an unprecedented West Coast-wide harmful algal bloom (HAB) extended from the Gulf of Alaska to southern California. The bloom was composed of <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em>, a toxigenic diatom that has the ability to produce domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin that can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) and threaten human health if affected shellfish are consumed. These satellite images show chlorophyll-a estimates averaged over the periods of March 27–31, 2015 (left panel), and May, 6–8, 2015 (right panel). Data source: Satellite data were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) using a combination of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) chlorophyll products. Data were processed using standard OBPG processing with 4 kilometer imagery. Figure: McCabe et al. 2016

<summary>Click for Details</summary> The Southern California Water Research Project uses a diversity index of tolerant and sensitive <a href='https://marinebon.org/cinms/glossary' target='_blank'>infauna</a>, also known as the Benthic Response Index (BRI), to gauge the ecosystem impact from anthropogenic contamination. The map above shows the 2013 locations of samples and the BRI trends at each location. Previously, island sites were all considered 100 percent pristine (reference), but now roughly 70 percent of samples are considered degraded from that status. Decline in BRI was particularly prevalent around Santa Cruz Island. This decline in BRI was not mirrored in other regions in southern California. The most recent samples, collected in 2013, found that ten of the 15 sites in Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary had infaunal community compositions that were shifting towards species more tolerant of degraded conditions (red) compared to the samples collected previously.

DDT is most prominent around the Ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Santa Monica Bay. DDT is a legacy contaminant, which means it persists in the environment long after introduction. A large amount of DDT in the bight came from the dumping of the contaminant by the Montrose Chemical Company off Palos Verdes until the early 1980s, which is why the surrounding areas have high DDT levels. CINMS is relatively far from the spill site and thus, has limited DDT concentrations in sediments. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

<summary>Click for Details</summary> Percent area of impacted sediments by stratum and survey year in varying categories of exposure to sediment contamination are shown in the bar plot. Category 1 is minimal exposure; Category 2 is low exposure; Category 3 is moderate exposure; and Category 4 is high exposure. Categories are determined by two prominent chemistry indices determined by analyzing a suite of chemical concentrations present in sediment samples. Missing bars represent no data. In minimal exposure, sediment-associated contamination may be present, but exposure is unlikely to result in effects. In low exposure, small increase in contaminant exposure may be associated with increased effects, but magnitude or frequency of occurrence of biological impacts is low. In moderate exposure, there is clear evidence of sediment contaminant exposure at concentrations that are likely to result in biological effects. For high exposure, contaminant exposure is highly likely to result in substantial biological effects. The Channel Islands have no sediments in Category 4 and the large majority of sediments are in Category 1 or 2, thus indicating limited contamination impact in sanctuary sediments. At this time, the suites of chemical indices have not yet been completed for the 2008 bight-wide survey. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

Open circles indicate no plastic debris detected and filled circle diameter are proportional to particle concentrations (number per cubic meter). There was no relationship between the numerical concentration of particles and distance from shore, the presumed source of the majority of debris. Figure: Gilfillan et al. 2009
