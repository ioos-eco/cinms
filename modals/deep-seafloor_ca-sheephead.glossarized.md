Average density (per 100 m2 +/- SE) of California sheephead (*Semicossyphus pulcher*) at fished (blue) and unfished marine reserves (red) surveyed annually in two time periods 2005-2009 and 2014-2015. Density has increased since the baseline period, and the increase was more pronounced inside reserves as compared to fished sites.
