### Gorgonian Corals

![**Figure App.C.3.4.** Historical landings of fixed gear that could impact benthic habitats are shown along with the locations of deep-sea gorgonians in the map above. Fixed gear usage is moderate around the Channel Islands and likely impacts gorgonians in CINMS habitats. Data is from 2007 to 2011. Data source: CDFW, Perry et al 2010; Map: P. Etnoyer/NOAA, Etnoyer et al. 2015](../img/cinms_cr/App.C.3.4_SWFSC_Fixed2007-2011_Gorgonians.jpg)
