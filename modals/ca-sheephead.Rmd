### NPS: Biomass on Islands 

![**Figure App.F.12.12.** Average density (+/- standard error) of California sheephead _Semicossyphus pulcher_ at 14 sites across four islands in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary monitored by the PISCO kelp forest monitoring program from 2003 to 2016. Sheephead are counted by SCUBA divers swimming along transect lines. Observed density was averaged across all monitoring sites at each island, including sites located inside and outside of marine reserves and conservation areas, to examine course-scale trends by island. At a finer scale, sheephead density is responding differently inside and outside of some marine protected areas (MPAs) in CINMS. A discussion of MPA effects in CINMS is available in MPA Effects.

### PISCO: Density on Islands

![**Figure App.F.12.13.** Average density (+/- standard error) of California sheephead _Semicossyphus pulcher_ at Channel Islands National Park kelp forest monitoring sites at the five islands in CINMS. Recent increases in average density of sheephead were observed at every island except for San Miguel (blue). Sheephead density was averaged across all monitoring sites at each island, including sites located inside and outside of marine reserves and conservation areas, to examine course-scale trends by island. At a finer scale, sheephead density is responding differently inside and outside of some marine protected areas (MPAs) in CINMS. A discussion of MPA effects in CINMS is available in MPA Effects. Note that juveniles (< 10 centimeters) were excluded from analysis. Figure: Channel Islands National Park.](../img/cinms_cr/App.F.12.13.Semicossyphus_pulcher_CINP.jpg)

### LTER: Island vs Mainland

![**Figure App.F.12.14.** Average number (+/- standard error) of California sheephead _Semicossyphus pulcher_ at two island (dark blue) and nine mainland (light blue) sites monitored by the Santa Barbara Channel Long-term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) program. Abundance appears to be increasing at the island sites compared to the mainland sites. Data source: SBC LTER; Figure: R. Freedman/NOAA](../img/cinms_cr/App.F.12.14.Sheephead_LTER.jpg)

### MARE: Density In/Out MPAs

![**Figure App.F.12.16.** Average density (per 100 m2 +/- SE) of California sheephead (_Semicossyphus pulcher_) at fished (blue) and unfished marine reserves (red) surveyed annually in two time periods 2005–2009 and 2014–2015. Density has increased since the baseline period, and the increase was more pronounced inside reserves as compared to fished sites. Figure: MARE.](../img/cinms_cr/App.F.12.16.sheephead_MARE.jpg)
