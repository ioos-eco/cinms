Data is from NOAA’s Mussel Watch Program (monitored 1986–2010). Silver values have been slowly declining in <em>Mytilus</em> spp. tissue. There are multiple potential explanations for this finding, including limited spatial resolution, limited recent data, possible return to background levels consistent with the southern California mainland after remediation, or improved instrumentation and analytics that have been developed since data collection began. Due to this, more through research and data collection is required to confirm this trend. Figure: D. Whitall/NOAA, Mussel Watch</p>

Mean Total Extractables (TE) for individual Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons or PAHs are compared between Channel Islands (blue) and other offshore sites (red).

Concentrations of PAHs are variable, but concentrations at CINMS are usually equivalent, if not lower than other offshore locations.
