The Southern California Water Research Project uses a diversity index of tolerant and sensitive infauna, also known as the Benthic Response Index (BRI), to gauge the ecosystem impact from anthropogenic contamination. The map above shows the 2013 locations of samples and the BRI trends at each location. Previously, island sites were all considered 100 percent pristine (reference), but now roughly 70 percent of samples are considered degraded from that status. Decline in BRI was particularly prevalent around Santa Cruz Island. This decline in BRI was not mirrored in other regions in southern California. The most recent samples, collected in 2013, found that ten of the 15 sites in Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary had infaunal community compositions that were shifting towards species more tolerant of degraded conditions (red) compared to the samples collected previously.
