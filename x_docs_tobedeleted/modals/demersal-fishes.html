Common and scientific names of species selected for calculation of recent trends in CPUE from NMFS NWFSC Hook and Line surveys in the Southern California Bight. Of the more than 50 different species encountered in surveys from 2004—2015, the 15 species that were encountered most often (top 15 ranked species) were selected with the exception of sanddabs and squarespot rockfish, which are not well sampled by this survey method. The trend in annual CPUE was determined for the period 2009—2015 and is shown as increasing (↗), decreasing (↘), or no trend (↔) at the three spatial scales shown in Figure App.F.13.20. Three targeted or protected species were also included: cowcod, canary, and yelloweye rockfish (Note: These species were rarely encountered so observed trends may be misleading). Most strong regional trends (Southern California Bight and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary region) are reflected at the CINMS-level. Regional recovery or recruitment-driven population increases appears to be occurring for several species, including lingcod and bank rockfish. Trends were not strong for some rare species (e.g., cowcod and yelloweye). The CINMS trend was different than the larger sampling area for some species (e.g., bocaccio, chilipepper, and greenspotted rockfish) possibly influenced by depth segregation, effects of the Channel Islands network of MPAs, or regional/site level-effects amplified by low sample sizes.
