### Islands

![**Figure App.F.12.5.** Mean density (+/- standard error) of red sea urchin _Mesocentrotus franciscanus_ (top) and purple sea urchin _Strongylocentrotus purpuratus_ (bottom) at 14 sites across four islands in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary monitored by the PISCO kelp forest monitoring program from 2003â€“2016. Recently, density of both species has declined at eastern islands (Anacapa and Santa Cruz) and increased at western islands (Santa Rosa and San Miguel). Sea urchins are counted by SCUBA divers swimming along transect lines. Sea urchin density was averaged across all monitoring sites at each island, including sites located inside and outside of marine reserves and conservation areas, to examine course-scale trends by island. At a finer scale, sea urchin density is responding differently inside and outside of some marine protected areas (MPAs) in CINMS. A discussion of MPA effects in CINMS is available in MPA Effects.

### Island vs Mainland

![**Figure App.F.12.6.** Average abundance (+/- standard error) of sea urchins (red sea urchin _Mesocentrotus franciscanus_ and purple sea urchin _Strongylocentrotus purpuratus_ combined) at two island (dark blue) and nine mainland (light blue) kelp forest sites monitored by the Santa Barbara Channel Long-term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) program. Overall abundance of sea urchins appears stable at island sites over the available time series. Data source: SBC LTER; Figure: R. Freedman/NOAA](../img/cinms_cr/App.F.12.6_urchins_LTER.jpg)
