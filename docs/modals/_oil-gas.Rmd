### Oil & Gas

![**Figure App.C.4.17.** The status and trends of offshore oil and gas activity in southern California was measured using a normalized index of oil and gas production from offshore wells in state and federal waters in California. Activity has been stable over the last five years, but the short-term average was well below the long-term average (dashed green line). A rather steady decrease in oil and gas production has occurred since the mid-1990s.

##### 2015 Refugio Oil Spill

![**Figure App.C.2.3.** Diagonal black lines cover the area where oil sheen was observed after the 2015 Refugio Oil Spill. The dark black line indicates the short-term fishery closures. See Figures C2.4 and C13.5 for the modeled oil transport, which predicts crude oil reaching sanctuary waters, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz islands north-facing beaches days after the spill.
